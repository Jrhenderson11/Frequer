# Frequer
My personal adaptation of Adafruits Freqshow (https://github.com/adafruit/FreqShow), designed to display SDR outputs, friendly to a raspberry pi touchscreen


Original README from Adafruit:

	Raspberry Pi & PiTFT-based RTL-SDR frequency scanning and display tool. See installation and usage instructions in the guide at: https://learn.adafruit.com/freq-show-raspberry-pi-rtl-sdr-scanner/
